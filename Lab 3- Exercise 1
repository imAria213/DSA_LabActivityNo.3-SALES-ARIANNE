# Lab exercise 1
# Instructions:
# from a given list of integers, create a new list using comprehension that will compute the square of odd integer elements.
    # sample calls:
      # [2,4,3] == [9]
      # [0,0,1,1] == [1,1]

def square_of_odds(lst):
    return [x**2 for x in lst if x % 2 != 0]

print(square_of_odds([2, 4, 3]))
print(square_of_odds([0, 0, 1, 1]))
